### What is this repository for? 

* SocialX ICO web3 files to display contract info and add white listed members
* ver 1.0
* for crowd funding during the pre and ICO phase


### How do I get set up? 

* Currently contract is deployed on https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0xf838f85d4f4fe492ed02764935b63af89820a55e
* and uses Metamask to interfact with the contract. https://metamask.io/
* You will need to get some fake Ether from ehter faucet https://faucet.rinkeby.io/


### How do I run

* opening page whitelistuser.html will open basic page which will display contract current status and two options to white list member and check if member is white listed. 
In case you deploy new contract, you will need to update it in file interface.js
